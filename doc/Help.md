```bash
Usage:
  traceroute [ -dFITnrUV ] [ -f first_ttl ] [ -i device ] [ -m max_ttl ] [ -N squeries ] [ -p port ] [ -t tos ] [ -w MAX,HERE,NEAR ] [ -q nqueries ] [ -s src_addr ] [ -z sendwait ] host [ packetlen ]
Options:
  -d  --debug                 Enable socket level debugging
  -f first_ttl  --first=first_ttl
                              Start from the first_ttl hop (instead from 1)
  -I  --icmp                  Use ICMP ECHO for tracerouting
  -T  --tcp                   Use TCP SYN for tracerouting (default port is 80)
  -i device  --interface=device
                              Specify a network interface to operate with
  -m max_ttl  --max-hops=max_ttl
                              Set the max number of hops (max TTL to be
                              reached). Default is 30
  -N squeries  --sim-queries=squeries
                              Set the number of probes to be tried
                              simultaneously (default is 16)
  -n                          Do not resolve IP addresses to their domain names
  -p port  --port=port        Set the destination port to use. It is either
                              initial udp port value for "default" method
                              (incremented by each probe, default is 33434), or
                              initial seq for "icmp" (incremented as well,
                              default from 1), or some constant destination
                              port for other methods (with default of 80 for
                              "tcp", 53 for "udp", etc.)
  -t tos  --tos=tos           Set the TOS (IPv4 type of service)
  -w MAX,HERE,NEAR  --wait=MAX,HERE,NEAR
                              Wait for a probe no more than HERE (default 3)
                              times longer than a response from the same hop,
                              or no more than NEAR (default 10) times than some
                              next hop, or MAX (default 5.0) seconds (float
                              point values allowed too)
  -q nqueries  --queries=nqueries
                              Set the number of probes per each hop. Default is
                              3
  -r                          Bypass the normal routing and send directly to a
                              host on an attached network
  -s src_addr  --source=src_addr
                              Use source src_addr for outgoing packets
  -z sendwait  --sendwait=sendwait
                              Minimal time interval between probes (default 0).
                              If the value is more than 10, then it specifies a
                              number in milliseconds, else it is a number of
                              seconds (float point values allowed too)
  --fwmark=num                Set firewall mark for outgoing packets
  -U  --udp                   Use UDP to particular port for tracerouting
                              (instead of increasing the port per each probe),
                              default port is 53

  -V  --version               Print version info and exit
  --help                      Read this help and exit

Arguments:
+     host          The host to traceroute to
      packetlen     The full packet length (default is the length of an IP
                    header plus 40). Can be ignored or increased to a minimal
                    allowed value
